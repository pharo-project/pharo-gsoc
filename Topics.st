    title: 'Closing the Loop';
    contact: 'stephan@legacycode.nl, christopher.fuhrman@etsmtl.ca';
    supervisors: 'Stephan Eggermont, Christopher Fuhrman';
    keywords: 'deprecations, adaptability';
    context: 'Pharo wants to be able to continue to change and adapt itself to an ever changing environment. In order to do that it needs to become more modular and make currently non-essential code easy to unload and reload on demand. With the in-system tests and CI there currently is a pretty good feedback loop telling Pharo developers when they break existing in-image code.

That feedback loop is much weaker with external code. That code is often not developed in sync with the Pharo development. It is developed against a stable release or against the then current version of the development version. A lot of code is developed in student projects that don''t have the continuity that Pharo itself has. Other code is developed for specific customers who are not interested in upgrading it. Even if there are sufficient tests and an automated build for that code, there often is not enough incentive and priority for it to be kept up to date.

Achieving more adaptability and agility for Pharo can be found by making it easier to keep more code up to date, or by making it easier to bring removed code up to date again. This proposal is about the latter.

When refactoring or rewriting some code, looking at the senders of a message and references to a class is one of the basic things to do to get a good understanding of how that code is actually used. Currently that only works in-image. When Pharo was a 32-bit environment that made sense, but with the current support for large images it should be possible to provide that information for all open source smalltalk code, and also to provide historic/version information for it.   

Some experiments have been done already to establish the viability: code (for older Pharo versions) is available on smalltalkhub: StephanEggermont/DeprecationFinder and StephanEggermont/MonticelloProjects';
    goal: 'Analyze the source code of publicly available monticello/tonel packages and determine which classes and methods are used and defined by them (senders/references) (see DeprecationFinder). For Monticello use the history and deduplicate source code versions to reduce the amount of data that needs to be handled (see MonticelloProjects). Apply to projects on smalltalkhub and older repositories. 

Provide a api and a gui so Pharo developers can quickly access this information, and browse global and historic users.';

with the same system of files. 
In some ways, IPFS is similar to the Web, but IPFS could be seen as a single BitTorrent swarm, 
exchanging objects within one Git repository. 
In other words, IPFS provides a high throughput content-addressed block storage model, with content-addressed hyperlinks. 
This forms a generalized Merkle DAG, a data structure upon which one can build versioned file systems, blockchains, 
and even a Permanent Web. 
IPFS combines a distributed hashtable, an incentivized block exchange, and a self-certifying namespace. 
IPFS has no single point of failure, and nodes do not need to trust each other.
IPFS right now is implemented as a server process in Go and allows the global file system to be mounted as a user 
space filesystem. In addition, the server provides an API.
A real integration of IPFS with Pharo would require a complete implementation of IPFS in Pharo 
(projects are already in early stages to implement it in JavaScript and Python).
But the client API allows us already now to do experiments and assess the usefulness of IPFS in the context of Pharo. 
More information:

The idea is to create a modular collection library for Pharo users. Containers’s goals is to develop new efficient, well-tested, well documented collections. 
Containers contains already Tree, Grid, SkipList, LinkedList, OrderedDictionary but there is a need to revisit them. 

Finally Pharo 6.0 comes with two powerful primitives: new object immutability primitives as well as ephemerons [Hayes97].

With such important primitives two tasks can be performed: 
	- design new weak collections taking advantage of ephemerons.
	- revisit and design new concurrent collections taking advantage of immutability.

       context: 'The objective is to produce an initial model that represents the Control-Graph-Flow (CFG) of an Pharo application. 
For doing so, we need to perform an static analysis on the program. The analysis of the program is done traversing Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) of the methods, and class definitions.
Pharo provides a set of existent tools to manipulate and traverse ASTs, and reflective tools to inspect programs in Pharo.
Also, there are implementations of required tools to be used or extended (AST interpreters, CFG extraction tools, type inferers (Phineas), etc).
This task can be divided in three main points: (1) developing the CFG model, (2) extract the information from the Pharo AST, (3) perform traversal and analyses over it. 
For extracting the information in the AST and form the CGF, the student should use tools already existent in Pharo (AST interpreters / Type inferer). 
Finally, it can be possible to perform an analysis on the existing information. For example, it is possible to extract the effective classes and methods that are covered by a given test; or calculate the dependencies between classes and methods.
This topic provides an oportunity of working on the metalevel of programs, the student will learn how to get information from an existing program, and how to reflect about it. 
These tools and abilities are basic when working with programming languages, refactorings, tools, etc.';

The basic idea of control flow analysis is to have a graph representing the pieces of code (e.g. expressions, statements, blocks, methods, or whole program) and illustrating the possible order and conditions of their execution.
Data flow analysis shows how a given data is created, used and modified in the code.
By applying basic algorithms one can derive def-use and use-def chains of variables, program slices,  static single assignment form, etc.
Flow extraction relies with, but also intervene in, type inference computation.';
