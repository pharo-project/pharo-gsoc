SUnit is a unit-testing framework (which is also first in its kind). Pharo''s syntax is very simple and can fit on a post card. To achieve this, language was designed in a way that focuses only on the core concepts of object-oriented programming. For example there are no direct field accessors as they break the whole concept of encapsulation. While this is good for software design, some parts like unit tests may benefit from direct access to the state of an object.';
