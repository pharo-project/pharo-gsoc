    "description": "This project involves creating a virtual marketplace where users can create and trade digital assets using smart contracts, with penalties for front-running or other forms of market manipulation. An algorithm could recognize when market manipulation is occurring, and the developed model will help to detect patterns of abnormal trading activities and impose punishments accordingly, such as account suspensions or financial penalties for offenders engaging in front-running practices. It also could introduce a “reputation score” feature to reward users who are more compliant with the rules and penalize those who break them. CORMAS (A platofrm for COmmon-pool Resources and Multi-Agent Simulations in Pharo) could be used to speed up developement.",

    "description": "Live coding, sometimes referred to as on-the-fly programming,  is an increasingly popular creative  technique for performing electronic music and arts  centred on the writing code in public and the use of interactive programming in an improvised way. [TidalCycles](https://tidalcycles.org) is the most popular live coding environment for improvising music with algorithmic patterns. Developed in 2009, it is a domain specific language embedded in Haskell which uses to generate sounds the SuperDirt engine for [SuperCollider](https://supercollider.github.io), communicating with it via the OpenSoundControl protocol; in the recent years several non-Haskell projects has focused on porting TidalCycles features, the two most successful being Vortex (for Python ) and Strudel (for Javascript) Syzygie is a package intended to port to Pharo the mini-notation for sequences used by TidalCycles, that in turn is inspired by Bernard Bel’s [Bol Processor](https://bolprocessor.org).",

    "description": "This project aims to enable an efficient deployment mechanism for Pharo applications, where they run in a Docker scratch (layer 0) image without any operating system dependency or overhead. Being able to run pharo in an efficient docker image simplifies deployment particularly in the web space where docker images are becoming a defacto standard. Pharo is quite unique as its possible to run without any file io dependencies in a self contained manner that matches scratch image requirements. The smaller size of a scratch image also means improved resource management and also reduces secuirty risks inherent with operating system overhead that isn't needed for many classes of pharo application, particularly web based ones. The student will need to study the hello world docker scratch example and then figure out how to statically compile the vm, necessary plugins and image so that no dynamic operating system dependencies are needed for execution.",
