    "description": "To produce an initial model that represents the Control-Graph-Flow (CFG) of an Pharo application, including application tests, we need to perform an static analysis on the program. The analysis of the program is done traversing Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) of the methods, and class definitions. Pharo provides a set of existent tools to manipulate and traverse ASTs, and reflective tools to inspect programs in Pharo. Also, there are implementations of required tools to be used or extended (AST interpreters, CFG extraction tools, type inferers (Phineas), etc). This task can be divided in three main points: (1) developing the CFG model, (2) extract the information from the Pharo AST, (3) perform traversal and analyses over it. For extracting the information in the AST and form the CGF, the student should use tools already existent in Pharo (AST interpreters/Type inferer). Finally, it can be possible to perform an analysis on the existing information. For example, it is possible to extract the effective classes and methods that are covered by a given test; or calculate the dependencies between classes and methods. This topic provides an oportunity of working on the meta-level of programs, while the student will learn how to get information from an existing program, and how to reflect about it. These tools and abilities are basic when working with programming languages, refactorings, tools, etc.",

Originally pioneered in Smalltalk, the refactoring engine plays a crucial role in maintaining code quality, improving design, and enhancing developer productivity. This proposal aims to improve Pharo’s refactoring engine by addressing usability, migrating to modern tools, and extending its capabilities with additional refactorings. By refining the refactoring workflow, this project will ensure a smoother experience for developers while keeping Pharo’s tooling at the forefront of modern software engineering practices. Ideal project to learn a lot about Pharo, ASTs, desgin, refactorings, software engineering in general!",
