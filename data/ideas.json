    "description": "This project aims to enable an efficient deployment mechanism for Pharo applications, where they run in a Docker scratch (layer 0) image without any operating system dependency or overhead. Being able to run pharo in an efficient docker image simplifies deployment particularly in the web space where docker images are becoming a defacto standard. Pharo is quite unique as its possible to run without any file io dependencies in a self contained manner that matches scratch image requirements. The smaller size of a scratch image also means improved resource management and also reduces secuirty risks inherent with operating system overhead that isn't needed for many classes of pharo application, particularly web based ones. The student will need to study the hello world docker scratch example and then figure out how to statically compile the vm, necessary plugins and image so that no dynamic operating system dependencies are needed for execution.",

Also, there are implementations of required tools to be used or extended (AST interpreters, CFG extraction tools, type inferers (Phineas), etc). This task can be divided in three main points: (1) developing the CFG model, (2) extract the information from the Pharo AST, (3) perform traversal and analyses over it. For extracting the information in the AST and form the CGF, the student should use tools already existent in Pharo (AST interpreters/Type inferer). Finally, it can be possible to perform an analysis on the existing information. For example, it is possible to extract the effective classes and methods that are covered by a given test; or calculate the dependencies between classes and methods. This topic provides an oportunity of working on the meta-level of programs, while the student will learn how to get information from an existing program, and how to reflect about it.

    "description": "[Moose](https://moosetechnology.org/) is a platform for software and data analysis implemented in Pharo. It provides an extensive toolkit for exploring the source code of a given project, find code defects, bad practices, etc. Cormas is a legacy software system that has been in development for more than 25 years. It has been migrated from one dialect of Smalltalk to another, it has been maintained by different people with different levels of expertise and different programming practices. As such, Cormas is a very interesting case study for code analysis. Using Moose, we can detect dead code (methods that are no longer used), split god classes and methods (the ones that are clearly too large), reorganize packages to reduce coupling, improve test coverage. All this information can be extremely valuable for Cormas development and it can also contribute to the improvement of Moose platform.",
