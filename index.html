The recent decision by Google to deprecate and stop its API for the Google Issue Tracker used by a.o. the Pharo, Seaside, MOOSE and Metacello projects makes it necessary for those projects to select a different issue tracker. The timespan before this decision has to be made is too short for the development of a new issue tracker from scratch. 

Now most development in Smalltalk uses distributed version control systems, either Monticello or Git, the question arises why these projects still would want to use a centralized issue tracker. The long-standing problems in keeping squeaksource up-and-running are only one example of the problems of depending on centralized infrastructure. Other examples are the move of Lukas' repository and the number of times where the Pharo CI infrastructure was not available, especially on holidays and weekends.

The currently used issue trackers cannot work disconnected. Integrating the issue tracker in the CI workflow of the projects is crucial.

The goals of the persona should be translated into a storymap. Delivery should be iterative and incremental, driven by value to the community and technical risk. The student is expected to be active on the mailing list and discuss development there. This includes handling (source) contributions by others.

There is a small prototype available. 

Benefits to the Student

getting to know the difficulties of issue tracking/the workflow of open source projects
experience with distributed systems
experience an agile open source environment
Benefits to the Community

better integrated workflow
native issue tracker, accessible both in-image, web and automated
showcase for productive environment  </td></tr><tr><td>Goal</td><td>A native smalltalk distributed issue tracker. It should have basic issue tracking functionality including attaching files/pictures/code. It should have a native interface, a web interface and a scripting API. Primary development is in Pharo.

Issue trackers have different kind of users. To make clear that different users have different needs, persona can be helpful. 

Isabelle is an information technology student looking for an interesting language and environment to learn. She wants to contribute to and learn from a smart community and needs interesting experiences on her cv. She has already learned the basics of a few mainstream languages and feels ready to try something more exotic. Smalltalk seems interesting as the origin of many inventions.

Yann is the major developer of a web-based platform based on Pharo and Seaside. He needs to ensure the platform keeps working smoothly and is updated regularly with the latest changes. In production he uses the released versions. He fears the major clean-ups Pharo is making make it difficult for him to keep up. He is dependent on a few old unmaintained squeaksource packages.

Janine just found an interesting old package on squeaksource. It was last changed in 2007. She has been using smalltalk for a few years, so knows what to expect when trying to load an unmaintained package. There are some missing classes that still exist in squeak.

Tony is the developer of a package that is used with nearly all smalltalks. He mainly works with a commercial smalltalk and keeps just enough contact with the Pharo community to keep his package working. He has complained about some changes that made it necessary for him to change his package structure. He mainly updates the Pharo version on his way to and from the office in the train. 

Eve maintains a few of the crucial Pharo kernel packages. They are under heavy development and once in a while everything breaks, leading to a flood of issues. They mostly come from outsiders, as she talks daily with the Pharo core team. She has to close a lot of them as duplicates. She also has to review code that gets attached in one form or another to the issue.

Daniel is a maintainer of the vm that forms the basis for the Pharo vm. The vm is used by many more projects.

Lara is a release manager for a well known linux distribution. Pharo is just one of 30 languages that are included in the distribution. Before doing a release she scans the issue tracker for any show stoppers. She had to stop including environments because of security issues.

Thabo has been using Excel to track bugs and issues internally in his company and would like to move to a new distributed tracking system built in Pharo. Apart from all the usual inputs and outputs, he needs to be able to import his massive excel spreedsheat, as perhaps csv, into the new tracking system.

They are supported directly by the virtual machine and use the garbage collector's tracing machinery 
to construct the objects to be saved.  They also contain objects in the native heap format of the virtual machine.  
Amongst other things, ImageSegments have been used for eToys to store student projects.  
There are literally thousands of eToys projects stored in ImageSegments in the format of the current VM.  
Spur is a new object representation for the Squeak and Pharo V M that offers more functionality and approximately 
twice the performance than the existing VM.</td></tr><tr><td>Goal</td><td>The goal is to allow ImageSegments written by the current VM version, or older VM versions, 
to be loaded into a system running on the Spur VM.

SUnit is a unit-testing framework (which is also first in its kind). Pharo's syntax is very simple and can fit on a post card. To achieve this, language was designed in a way that focuses only on the core concepts of object-oriented programming. For example there are no direct field accessors as they break the whole concept of encapsulation. While this is good for software design, some parts like unit tests may benefit from direct access to the state of an object.</td></tr><tr><td>Goal</td><td>subclass the default compiler and add an expression(s) to access internal state of an object.

Pillar is the document model from the Pier CMS and
provides exports to (a.o) html and LaTeX. It is a
simplified form of the LaTeX document model
without a WYSIWYG UI.

In the research world two documentation systems
dominate: LaTeX and Word. Word and its clones
dominate areas where ease of use for small papers
without maths are important, LaTeX the other fields.

From personal experience I know that the lack of
abstraction in Word and clones makes it very expensive
to create large, consistently formatted documents.
In addition, the typographical quality of the resulting
documents is much lower than that achievable with
LaTeX.

On the other hand, repurposing LaTeX to generate
anything other than PDF/paper documentation is
difficult because of the underlying language that
LaTeX is written in, and there is no easy to use
WYSIWYG UI for LaTeX.

It pains me to see the return of text based formatting
with primitive formats like markdown. At least in LaTeX
you can preserve semantics level content, in markdown
we are back at html 1.0.

The program I liked best for creating longer documents
was Framemaker. That provided the needed abstractions
in an efficient WYSIWYG UI. Framemaker was sold
from 1986, so the performance of current hardware
should be enough to run something similar in smalltalk.
I used versions 5.5 and 6, and had to abandon it when
Adobe stopped development and it was never migrated
from PowerPC.

Framemaker was fast enough to create books with
hundreds and even thousands of pages. It had working
versions of the long document features Word claimed to
have.

With Athens, Rubric and TxText we now have low level
abstractions for dealing with cursor and selection, fonts,
rendering glyphs and having both on-screen and 
PDF output. Bloc provvides the abstractions for an advanced GUI.

Consider the following model:

A book consists of a number of named documents.
This is essential for dealing with longer material, as
in a wysiwyg system we want to avoid having to re-layout
too much after a key is pressed. Across documents we only
need to remember the starting page/section numbers.

Each document consists of pages. On a page there can be fixed
content and content that is dependent on the text flow.
Most pages of a document have a similar layout, so each page
refers to a masterpage that defines the default content.
A document can have separate masterpages for
first, left and right pages, and rotated or extra large ones. 
A masterpage can define fixed items and calculated ones
(pagenumbers and current chapter). A textframedefinition
describes the textframes and the textflow for each textframe.

The text (and other in-line contents) of the document are stored
in paragraphs, which are stored in textflows.
The paragraphstyle of a paragraph knows how to layout it in
a textframe, and how to deal with the end of a textframe.
The paragraphstyle knows how to paginate, how to number
or provide other autotext at the beginning of a paragraph and
if the paragraph text should be part of a table of contents.
A textframe is  a (rectangular) area on a page.
The characterstyle of a paragraph is responsible for the font family,
size and style. The characterstyle can be overridden
by a specific paragraph or by a textrange.

With a model like this (and adding maths, tables, notes, figures
and references) we should be able to use Pharo to create both
high-quality documentation, and write research articles
(and books) in-image.

This model maps well to but is an extension of the cocoa and gnustep 
text model that use textstorage, textcontainer, typesetter, layoutmanager, 
glyphgenerator, textview and textinput.

It may be worth to consider making this into a sequence that is read and processed lazily, to deal with CSV files bigger than memory.

When data is finally in, usually the first task is doing some processing, inspection or visualization. The Smalltalk collections are
good for processing (although some lazy variants might help), and Roassal and the inspectors are perfect for visualization and browsing.

It could be extended as follows: The second part comes the time when one wants to run some algorithm. While there is no need to have the fanciest ones, there should be some
of the basics, such as:
- some form or regression (linear, logistic...)
- some form of clustering (kmeans, dbscan, canopy...)

Another thing which would be useful is support for linear algebra, leveraging native libraries such as BLAS or LAPACK.

Ideally, I would include also some tutorials, for instance for dealing with standard problems such as Kaggle competitions. Here I think
Smalltalk would have an edge, since these tutorial could be in the form of Prof Stef. Still, it would be nice if some form of the tutorials was also on the web, which makes it discoverable.

In some ways, IPFS is similar to the Web, but IPFS could be seen as a single BitTorrent swarm, exchanging objects within one Git repository. In other words, IPFS provides a high throughput content-addressed block storage model, with content-addressed hyperlinks. This forms a generalized Merkle DAG, a data structure upon which one can build versioned file systems, blockchains, and even a Permanent Web. IPFS combines a distributed hashtable, an incentivized block exchange, and a self-certifying namespace. IPFS has no single point of failure, and nodes do not need to trust each other.

IPFS right now is implemented as a server process in Go and allows the global file system to be mounted as a user space filesystem. In addition, the server provides an API.
A real integration of IPFS with Pharo would require a complete implementation of IPFS in Pharo (projects are already in early stages to implement it in JavaScript and Python).
But the client API allows us already now to do experiments and assess the usefulness of IPFS in the context of Pharo.

cdb is a fast, reliable, simple package for creating and reading constant databases. Its database structure provides several features:
Fast lookups: A successful lookup in a large database normally takes just two disk accesses. An unsuccessful lookup takes only one.
Low overhead: A database uses 2048 bytes, plus 24 bytes per record, plus the space for keys and data.
No random limits: cdb can handle any database up to 4 gigabytes. There are no other restrictions; records don't even have to fit into memory. Databases are stored in a machine-independent format.
Fast atomic database replacement: cdbmake can rewrite an entire database two orders of magnitude faster than other hashing packages.
Fast database dumps: cdbdump prints the contents of a database in cdbmake-compatible format.

If we can describe both migrations with refactorings, 
we should be able to create builds in ci for both that show 
when changes break things and otherwise synchronize two-way. 

This might also be beneficial for Roassal2 and Seaside, that 
currently use a compatibility layer. 

Another place where this rewriting can be useful would be 
in maintaining compatibility between Squeak and Pharo, 
and in making it easier keeping older code alive. 

Marcel Taeumel has written a number of interesting applications 
(UIBuilder, Widgets, XPForums) using a 'signals' style 
communication. In Pharo it would make sense to have them 
use Announcements.

One of the problem is how to deal with incomplete code. One idea is to use heuristics to propose some nodes to make the AST well-formed. One idea could be to reformat after each space or dot. A possible path is to see if this is possible to use the potential followers (in terms of Petit Parser) to complement the AST.
(1) Studying the default static formatter of Pharo, (2) Studying Petit Parser, (3) Adding a special error handling to Petit Parser, (4) Experiment and selecting heuristics</td></tr><tr><td>Level</td><td>Advanced</td></tr><tr><td>Candidate</td><td>Topic still free</td></tr></table></p></a>

This tool is also capable of producing static analyzer rules that detect an old API usage in source code and provide a possibility to automatically change it to the new one. Although the tool was proven to work well it was never used for two reasons: 1) At the time when it was developed Pharo didn’t have a nice UI for reporting critics generated by the rules. 2) You had to setup API Evolution Miner by yourself and manually recover the rules. While the first issue is currently mitigated by QualityAssistant, the second one still persists.</td></tr><tr><td>Goal</td><td>The goal of this project is to create a continuous integration service that will allow to easily register your projects and will provide rules to you in a semi-intrusive way when they are ready.</td></tr><tr><td>Level</td><td>Entry-Intermediate</td></tr><tr><td>Candidate</td><td>Topic still free</td></tr></table></p></a>
